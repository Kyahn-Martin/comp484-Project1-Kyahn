            <h3>The Night Stalker</h3>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Drifter is a close range assassin who specilizes in mowing down backline low hp enemies,and isolating
                small groups of enemies to deal bonus damgage and disorient them. Drifter's kit is focused on marking
                an enemy hero to then jump behind and kill them before them or their team can react.

                <p>
                    Isolated heroes leave a trail as they move, and emit their heartbeat from afar.
                    <br>You deal amplified damage against isolated heroes, and killing them grants you permanent
                    weapon damage.

                <p>
                    Surround nearby enemy heroes in darkness, severely limiting their vision of other units. 
                    Affected enemies are briefly revealed.<br>
                    You gain  bonus sprint speed and your attacks proc  spirit damage for the duration
                </p>

        <h3>My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Drifter is a strong hero in the early game, but if he doesn't get permanent weapon damage from killing 
            isolated heroes early on, he can fall off in the late game. His kit is focused on picking off low hp and 
            isolated targets, if he doesn't get those kills early on, he can struggle to find them later in the game. 
            He is a strong hero to play against low mobility or high hp heroes since he has very consistant but moderate 
            damage.Overall I think Drifter is a fun hero to play, but he can feel very weak when you aren't snowballing 
            kills in the early game.
