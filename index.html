        <h3>Article Overview</h3>
        <p> Deadlock is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where two teams of six battle each other to summon their
            respective patrons by destroying the enemy team's base. Each player chooses a hero with unique abilities and
            playstyles. For this project I will be showing the kits of three heroes and my thoughts on how fun they are to
            play, and how fun they are to play against.

        <h3>Basics of Deadlock</h3>
        <p> The game is played on a map with three lanes, and a jungle in between. Each lane has one guardian, one walker
            , and two base guardians leading to the main base. Each base contains two shrines to the patron. Once both shrines
            are destroyed the patron can be harmed by the enemy team. The first team to destroy the enemy patron wins the game.
            Players earn souls by killing enemy heroes, minions, and base defenders. Souls are used to earn boons 
            (Levels) and buy items. Each hero has four abilities and starts the game with one of them, the other three are 
            unlocked at boon
