        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Seven is an immovile mage who will use massave area denial and high consistant damage to slaughter
            groups of enemies. Seven's kit is focused on his ultimate, which is a large area of effect that deals 
            massave damage over time
        </p>

                    <h4>Lightning Ball</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shoot a ball of lightning that travels in a straight line. Does damage to all targets in its 
                        radius. Slows down when damaging enemies and stops if it hits the world
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Static Charge
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Apply a charge to a target enemy hero. After a short duration, the static charge stuns and 
                        damages enemies within the radius.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Power Surge
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Power up your weapon with a shock effect, making your bullets proc shock damage on your target. 
                        This shock damage bounces to enemies near your target. Occurs once per burst shot.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Storm Cloud
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Channel an expanding storm cloud around you that damages all enemies within its radius. Enemies 
                        do not take damage when they are out of line-of-sight. You have increased Bullet Resist during 
                        the channel.<br>While channeling, press Fire button to mark the targeted area to be struck with 
                        a powerful lightning bolt that knocks enemies away after a 0.25s delay. One use per cast.
                    </p>
                </li>

        <h3>My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Seven is a very strong hero in the late game when he can spam his ultimate to cause massave damage in teamfights
            and apply massave area denial. However in the early game he will often struggle to deal significant damage to enemies
            since they can run out of the radius of his ball and his other basic abilities don't deal nearly as much damage.
            He is a bit boring to play in the early game since he doesn't have very much to do outside of farming minions 
            and surviving to the late game where he can be a teamfighting menace.
