        </hgroup>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Haze is a stealth based assassin who is excelent at picking off isolated targets and ambushing backline 
            heroes. She is an immobile hero who relies on her stealth and high damage to suprise and quickly kill 
            any mispositioned enemies.
        </p>
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Sleep Dagger</h4>
                    <p>
                        Throw a dagger that damages and sleeps the target. Sleeping targets wake up shortly after being 
                        damaged.<br> Throwing a Dagger does not break your invisibility.<br> Sleep Dagger does not interrupt 
                        enemies' channeling abilities.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Smoke bomb</h4>
                    <p>
                        Fade out of sight, becoming invisible and gaining sprint speed.<br> Attacking removes invisibility, 
                        but using items does not.<br>
                        Close enemies can see through your invisibility.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fixation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shooting a target increases your bullet damage on that target.<br> Gain one stack per bullet hit, 
                        two if the hit is a headshot.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Bullet Dance</h4>
                    <p>
                        Enter a flurry, firing your weapon at nearby enemies with perfect accuracy and added Bullet 
                        Damage.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3>My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Haze is very strong in a sustained fight but can struggle against multiple enemies since once she gets 
            into a fight her mobility is very limited and her fixation stacks only apply to the target she is attacking. 
            Early into the game she is very weak but with items and points invested into her abilities she is a 
            devestating deulist. While I enjoy playing Haze, the emphasis on her gun damage means she relies on tracking
            enemy heroes and landing headshots. This can be extremely difficult against highly mobile heroes or heroes with
            high burst damage.
